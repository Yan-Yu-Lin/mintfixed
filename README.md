This version of Mint fixes these issues:
- Fixed HTTP 403 errors (mod lookup) by removing the deprecated `visible` filter from mod.io API requests.
- Fixed HTTP 403 errors by replacing direct mod file metadata requests (`GET /mods/{id}/files/{file_id}`) with filtered list queries, restoring mod downloads.
- Limits the mission selector/server browser mod list to 100 entries, preventing hosting/invites from breaking when the mission selector mod list string becomes too large.
- Updated Trumans Repaker to make mods that need oodle compression work again automatically without needing to manually add a DLL (for example: https://mod.io/g/drg/m/missions-hud)

If you'd like to build it yourself from the original mint-repo, take a look at my commits to see the fixes I implemented.

## UE4SS.Lite (native DLL / JS) mods — optional

mint can also install mods for [UE4SS.Lite](https://github.com/iris-cat-dev/UE4SS.Lite)
("UE4SSL"), using the same folder layout as [MintCat](https://github.com/iris-cat-dev/mintcat).

- **Opt-in.** Nothing changes for profiles that only contain `.pak` mods: no extra files are
  written and the merged `mods_P.pak` is built exactly as before. UE4SSL support only does
  anything when a mod `.zip` contains a native DLL or a JS mod.
- **mint bundles no runtime.** The UE4SS.Lite loader (`UE4SSL.zip`) is not part of mint (it has no
  license). In the settings window (cogwheel) set the path to a `UE4SSL.zip` you already have (MintCat
  keeps one in its cache, e.g. `~/.cache/com.mint.cat/UE4SSL.zip` on Linux), or press **download**
  to fetch it from MintCat's release server
  (`https://yuri-oss-sg.oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com/update.json`); the download is checked
  against the published size and md5. A profile with DLL/JS mods and no `UE4SSL.zip` is refused
  before anything is written.
- **Native DLL mods are flagged and confirmed.** Mods containing a native DLL get an orange
  **native** label in the mod list (JS-only mods a grey **js** label). A native DLL runs inside the
  game process with the game's full permissions, so the first time a DLL is about to be installed
  mint asks for confirmation, listing the mods. The answer is remembered per DLL (by its SHA-256 in
  `config.json`), so updating a mod to a different DLL asks again. The command line asks the same
  question in the terminal.
- **Uninstall is manifest-driven.** Every file and folder mint creates for UE4SSL is recorded in
  `FSD/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/mods/.mint-managed.json`. "Uninstall mods" (and installing a profile
  without DLL/JS mods) removes exactly those and nothing else: folders in `ue4ss/mods/` that mint
  did not create, and loader files that were already there before mint, are left alone. Mods
  removed from the profile are deleted on the next install; a mod's own files (e.g. its `.log`)
  survive reinstalling it.

What mint looks for in a mod `.zip` (any combination is allowed):

| Part | Rule | Installed to (`FSD/Binaries/Win64/`) |
|---|---|---|
| pak | first `.pak` (unchanged) | merged into `mods_P.pak` |
| native DLL | `dll/main.dll`, otherwise the first `.dll` (never `dwmapi.dll` / `UE4SSL.dll`) | `ue4ss/mods/<mod>/main.dll` |
| JS mod | the `js/` folder containing `js/main.js` | `ue4ss/mods/<mod>/js/` |

`<mod>` is the mod's name in mint — for a local file, the file name including `.zip` (e.g.
`ue4ss/mods/AntiLag-0.1.0.zip/`), which matches MintCat so per-mod data carries over. The loader
files (`dwmapi.dll`, `ue4ss/UE4SSL.dll`, `ue4ss/mods/UE4SSL.JavaScript*`) are extracted from
`UE4SSL.zip`.

**Linux / Steam Deck (Proton):** the loader is a `dwmapi.dll` proxy, which Wine ignores unless told
otherwise. Set the game's Steam launch options to:

```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dwmapi=n,b" %command%
```

**Don't mix with MintCat's integration.** If MintCat has mods installed, uninstall them there first
(so `FSD-WindowsNoEditor_Mods.pak` is gone), otherwise the game loads two merged mod paks.

Thanks to MintCat for the install layout and to UE4SS.Lite for the loader.

# mint

3rd party mod integration tool for Deep Rock Galactic to download and integrate mods completely
externally of the game. This enables more stable mod usage as well as offline mod usage. Works for
both Steam and Microsoft Store versions.

<img alt="Graphical User Interface" src="https://github.com/trumank/mint/assets/1144160/0305419f-a2af-4349-9d63-12e19d97102f">

Mods are added via URL to a .pak or .zip containing a .pak. Mods can also be pulled from mod.io.
Examples:

 - `C:\Path\To\Local\Mod.zip`
 - `https://example.org/some-online-mod-repository/public-mod.pak`
 - `https://mod.io/g/drg/m/sandbox-utilities`

Mods from mod.io will require an OAuth token which can be obtained from <https://mod.io/me/access>
when prompted.

Most mods work just as if they were loaded via the official integration, but there are still some
behavioural differences. If a mod is crashing or otherwise behaving differently than when using the
official integration, *please* create an
[issue](https://github.com/trumank/mint/issues/new) so it can be addressed.

For more details, please consult our [user guide](https://github.com/trumank/mint/wiki).

## Usage

This section assumes that you are on Windows and is using the steam version of DRG, working with
either local `.pak`s or mod.io mods.

First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/trumank/mint/releases/latest)
compatible with your architecture. For windows, this will be the
`mint-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`. Extract this to anywhere you'd like to keep the
executable.

Then, we'll need to perform some first-time setup.

### First Time Setup

We need to provide the tool with the path to `FSD-WindowsNoEditor.pak` and a mod.io OAuth token if
you want to use mod.io mods. These can be configured in the settings menu (cogwheel located in the
bottom toolbar).

<img alt="Settings menu" src="https://github.com/trumank/mint/assets/1144160/b009a74c-b13a-4b84-95f9-4c59c6debb62">

#### Locating the DRG `FSD-WindowsNoEditor.pak`

If the tool fails to detect your DRG installation, then you can manually browse to add the path to
`FSD-WindowsNoEditor.pak`.

This file is located under the `FSD` folder inside your DRG installation directory, e.g.

```
E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\FSD-WindowsNoEditor.pak
```

#### Adding a mod.io OAuth Token

Inside the settings menu, there is a modio setting (cogwheel). If you click on that, it will prompt
for an mod.io OAuth token.

To generate a mod.io OAuth token, you'll need to visit <https://mod.io/me/access>. You'll need to
accept the API terms and conditions.

<img alt="mod.io Access page" src="https://github.com/trumank/mint/assets/1144160/2aeb6135-71c2-4c3c-8979-49e84b276bed">

Then, you'll need to add a new client under OAuth Access, call it e.g. "DRG Mod Integration".

For that client, create a new token named e.g. "modio-access" with Read-only scope. Copy the token
into the integration tool's prompt.

### Adding Mods

After these steps, you can now add local mods or mod.io mods.

#### Adding mod.io mods

Copy the URL to the mod into the "Add mods..." field and hit enter.

You can obtain a list of your subscribed mods list using the "Copy Mod URLs"
button via [A Better Modding Menu](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/a-better-modding-menu)
in game:

![Copy Mod URLs](https://github.com/trumank/mint/assets/1144160/375f441f-4762-4549-a241-1b54ed391b2f)

#### Adding a local mod

You can either drag and drop a local `.pak` file on to the tool window, or add the path to the
local `.pak` in the same "Add mods..." field.

### Updating Cache

The versioned mod.io mods are *cached*. If you want to update to the latest version of your mods,
you'll need to press the "Update cache" button.

### Installing/uninstalling mods

Once you are happy with your mod profile, you can install the mods by pressing the "Install mods"
button, and uninstall them with the "Uninstall mods" button. **This must be done while the game is
closed.**

## Using integrated mod support again

If you want to go back to the integrated mod support again, you must uninstall the mods installed by
mint. Then, launch the game normally.
